Do people nowadays feel lacking in meaning and purpose? Is it possible that liberalism, which has brought so much material wealth, has also lead to our social atomization and fragmentation?

This project will use the Google Books ngram corpus to examine this question over the past 100+ years. As in Kozlowski & Evans' "Geometry of Culture" paper, I will attempt to trace changes in society through changes in the usage of words. How are meaning/purpose/vocation/calling moving in relation to other concepts such as family, community or nation?

My primary text analysis method is word embeddings, created by training on decade-long slices of the corpus. As well, I may attempt to use classification models to predict whether individuals have or lack purpose based on their writing.
